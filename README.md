# Molecular-Graph-Neural-Network
<p> Augment pytraj to easily perform tasks for building graph convolutional networks from molecular dynamics data.</p>

<h2> Current Features </h2> 
<ul>
  <li> Construct adjacency matrix from topology file. </li> 
  <li> Construct "forces"  adjacency matrix by computing which atoms are a small enough distance from eachother for Lennard-Jones Forces to be significant (2.5 angstroms by default). </li>

</ul>
